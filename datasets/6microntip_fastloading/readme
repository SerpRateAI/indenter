Dataset of 32 indents across 10 grains obtained with the six micron radius tip at a fast loading rate (600 mN per minute as opposed to the 200 mN per minute of the slow loading experiments).
Two indents of note are grain1_6um_indent06 which has a pop-in at peak load, and grain9_6um_indent05 which has a pop-in during unloading.
Indent numbering continues from the slow loading indents, missing indents are due to bad experiments (e.g., the crystal broke).
