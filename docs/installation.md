# Installation

Install from PyPI (once published):

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install merrypopins

# For development
git clone https://github.com/SerpRateAI/merrypopins.git
cd merrypopins
pip install -e .
```

merrypopins supports Python 3.10+ and depends on:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

These are installed automatically via `pip`.

# Development & Testing

1. Install development requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -e '.[dev]'
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Pre-commit Hooks

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically check code formatting and linting before each commit. This helps ensure consistent code quality across the project.

### Setup (Run Once)

```bash
# After installing the development dependencies, set up pre-commit hooks:
# This will install the hooks defined in .pre-commit-config.yaml
pre-commit install
```

This sets up a Git hook that will run ruff and black automatically before each commit.

Run Manually

To run all checks on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Notes:
- Hooks are defined in .pre-commit-config.yaml.
- You can exclude specific files or directories (e.g., tutorials/) by modifying that config file.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests
2. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=merrypopins --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

3. Generate HTML coverage report:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=merrypopins --cov-report=html
   # open htmlcov/index.html in browser
   ```
