# Installation

Install from PyPI (once published):

```bash
# From PyPI
pip install merrypopins

# For development
git clone https://github.com/SerpRateAI/merrypopins.git
cd merrypopins
pip install -e .
```

merrypopins supports Python 3.10+ and depends on:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scipy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

These are installed automatically via `pip`.

All core and development dependencies are tested with Python 3.10 through 3.12.

# Development & Testing

1. Install development requirements:
   ```bash
    # For development (includes dev tools like pytest, black, ruff, etc.)
    pip install -e '.[dev]'
   ```
   This installs the main package and development dependencies listed in pyproject.toml under [project.optional-dependencies].dev

   Optionally, you can install development dependencies via:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

## ðŸ”§ Pre-commit Hooks

We rely on [**pre-commit**](https://pre-commit.com/) to auto-run **ruff** (lint) and **black** (format) against **every** change before it is committed.  
If these checks are **not** executed locally, your PR will fail in CI.

> **ðŸš¨ Important:** You must have the `pre-commit` package installed **globally**  
> (`pip install --user pre-commit` or via the projectâ€™s *dev* extras) **before** making commits.

### Setup (Run once per clone)

```bash
# 1) Install the tool (only needed if itâ€™s not already on your system)
pip install pre-commit          # or: pip install -e '.[dev]'

# 2) Install the Git hooks defined in .pre-commit-config.yaml
pre-commit install
```

This adds a Git hook that formats / lints the staged files automatically at each `git commit`.

Run Checks Manually

To run all checks on all files:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### What if the hook rejects my commit?

If `pre-commit` finds issues (usually formatting via **black** or lint via **ruff**),  
the commit will **abort** and the affected files will be *modified in-place* to satisfy the rules.

1. Open **Source Control** (e.g. the Git sidebar in VS Code).  
2. You will see the *updated* (but **unstaged**) files.
3. Click the **âž•** (stage) button next to each fixed file *or* `git add <file>`.
4. Re-run `git commit` â€“ it should now succeed.
5. Finally, push your branch to the remote.

> Tip: always run `pre-commit run --all-files` before making a commit to catch issues early.

Notes:
- Hooks are defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- You can exclude specific files or directories (e.g., `tutorials/`) by modifying the config file `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- CI will re-run the same hooks; commits that bypass them locally will be rejected.

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests
2. Run tests with coverage:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=merrypopins --cov-report=term-missing
   ```
   This command runs all tests in the `tests/` directory and generates a coverage report showing which lines of code were executed during the tests.
   Tests and linting are automatically run on each pull request via GitHub Actions. The CI uses Python 3.10â€“3.12 and runs pre-commit, pytest, and coverage checks.

3. Generate HTML coverage report:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=merrypopins --cov-report=html
   # open htmlcov/index.html in browser
   ```
